birth-moon
==========

someone told me that moon phase affects childbirth (but I don't belive it). This is a silly data driven exploration


Historical moon phases are available from [NASA](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases2001.html) but will need a little data munging. 

Birth records are harder to come by.
