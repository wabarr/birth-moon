birth-moon
==========

someone told me that moon phase affects childbirth (but I don't believe it). This is a silly data driven exploration


The [astral python module](http://pythonhosted.org/astral/module.html) deals nicely with calculating moon phases.

Birth records are harder to come by. I am working on getting a list from [California Birth Records database](http://www.californiabirthindex.org/)
